Script templates for common types of ECS scripts

# Setup
- Copy the ScriptTemplates folder to your project's ./Assets/ folder so you have your templates in this path: ./Assets/ScriptTemplates/
- The naming conventions for the path and filenames are important, so only modify them if you know what you're doing.
- Here's a blog that covers the process of creating templates: https://weirdbearddev.com/2020/08/01/creating-custom-unity-script-templates/
- If the project is open, restart it it.
- In Unity, you can now use the right-click context menu to can create C# scripts with the templates provided.
